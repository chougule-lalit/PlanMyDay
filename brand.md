# Brand Guidelines: Plan My Day

## 1. Brand Identity
* **App Name:** Plan My Day
* **Core Vibe:** Intelligent, Calm, Structured, Premium Utility.
* **Metaphor:** "The Second Brain." It is not a noisy alarm; it is a quiet, powerful executive assistant.

## 2. Color Palette (The "Focus System")
We use a semantic color system to denote energy levels and task types.

### Primary Backgrounds
* **Canvas (Dark Mode):** `#121212` (Almost Black, reduced eye strain)
* **Surface (Cards):** `#1E1E1E` (Slightly lighter, elevated)
* **Surface Active:** `#2C2C2C` (Interactive elements)

### Semantic Accents (The "Energy Code")
* **High Focus (Work/Deep Work):** `#4A90E2` (Calm, Deep Blue)
* **Commute/Travel:** `#F5A623` (Amber/Orange - indicates transition)
* **Personal/Health:** `#50E3C2` (Teal/Mint - refreshing)
* **Impossible/Warning:** `#FF5252` (Soft Red - urgent but not aggressive)
* **Success/Done:** `#7ED321` (Vibrant Green - dopamine hit)

### Typography
* **Font Family:** `Inter` or `Roboto` (Clean, sans-serif, high readability).
* **Headers:** Bold, Tight tracking.
* **Time Labels:** Monospace (e.g., `10:00`) for tabular alignment.

## 3. UI/UX Principles

### The "Linear Stream" Layout
* **Concept:** A vertical timeline that looks like a continuous stream of time.
* **Visuals:** A vertical line connects tasks to show flow. Gaps in the line represent "Free Time."
* **Cards:** Tasks are contained in rounded rectangular cards (Radius: 12px). They should not clutter the screen.

### The "Success Badge"
* **Interaction:** When a task is marked done, it does NOT disappear.
* **Visual:** It dims slightly (Opactiy 60%) and gains a glowing "Checkmark/Badge" icon.
* **Why:** To create a "Trophy Case" effect at the end of the day.

### Input Mode (The "Listening" State)
* When the user is speaking, the screen should focus entirely on the voice visualization (Waveform).
* Remove all other clutter. Focus on the user's intent.

## 4. Iconography
* Use **Outlined Icons** (Feather Icons or similar thin stroke) for a modern, technical look.
* **Travel Icons:** Use specific modes (Train, Car, Walk) to differentiate travel blocks instantly.
